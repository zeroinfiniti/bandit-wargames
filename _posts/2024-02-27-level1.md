## Task
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into **bandit1** using SSH.

## Theory
I have some basic knowledge of command lines. 

First is `cd`, short for *change directory*. I can use this command to change to another directory.

Second is `ls`, short for *list* and it will list out all the contents of the directory.

Third is `cat`, short for *concatenate*. It allows me to view the contents in the file.

Fourth is `pwd`, short for *print working directory*. It allows me to locate where I am in the directory.

## Solution
**Step 1:** To determine where I am located in the directory, I type `pwd`.

**Step 2:** As I am located in the home directory, there is no need for me to change directory. I list out the contents using `ls`.

**Step 3:** I've located the **readme** file. I type in `cat readme` to view the file's content.

**Step 4:** Password located. The resulting string is the password for *bandit1* which we will use for the next level.
