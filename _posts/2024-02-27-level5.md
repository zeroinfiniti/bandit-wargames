## Task
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the **inhere** directory. 

Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

**Username:** bandit4

**Password:** string provided in the *.hidden* file in the previous level

## Theory
First, it's important to define what "human-readable" means in this context. "Humand-readable" means that the data is presented in a format that is readable. The most common data encoding will be **ASCII text** and **Unicode**. 

This is in contrast to machine-readable data e.g. UPC barcodes or binary codes. 

Based on the task, I have to find a file with data that I can read, in the **inhere** directory.

## Solution
**Step 1:** Log in using the username and password in the task.

**Step 2:** Type **pwd** to confirm my location in the directory.

**Step 3:** Type **cd inhere** to change to the *inhere* directory.

**Step 4:** Type **ls -a** to list out all hidden and non-hidden files in the current working directory.

**Step 5:** I realised I need a more detailed list. So I typed **ls -la** to list all files in a long list format.

**Step 6:** There are 10 files listed. I realised it will take a long time for me to **cat** all the files one by one.

**Step 7:** To solve this, I can type in **file** to determine the file type. At the same time, I can use "*" wildcard. This wildcard will match any number of characters or a set of characters.

**Step 8:** Combining both commands, I use "file ./-file*" to determine the file types. I have to use **./** in the command as the files' names start with a dash (-).

**Step 9:** File 7 is identifited as a human-readable file. So I use the command **cat ./-file07** to read the contents.
