title: LEVEL 2
date: 2024-02-27

## Task
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **-**, located in the home directory.

**Username:** bandit1

**Password:** string provided in the *readme* file in the previous level

## Theory
The task is similiar to Level 1 in that I have to locate the file with a dash (-). 

Based on the previous level, I have determined that I will be in the home directory when I log in.

As such for this level, I will be only using the commands `ls` and `cat`. 

However, the file name is a dash (-). Typing this in the command line might make the command think I'm trying to type in a command option, e.g. typing `-p` means I'm choosing a port.

To located the **-** file, I will need to type in `./-`. This dot slash (./) helps to hide the dash (-) from the command.

## Solution
**Step 1:** Log in using the username and password in the task.

**Step 2:** List out directory's contents using `ls`.

**Step 3:** Type in the command `cat ./-` to read the contents in the file.

*28 Feb 2024 update: I learned that in Linux, a dash (-) followed by a character or word, is known as a flag:*
> Flags, also known as options or switches, play a crucial role in the command-line interface of Linux. They provide a way to modify the behavior of commands and enable additional functionalities. The behavior of Linux commands can often be changed by a number of Linux flags, sometimes known as options or switches.
