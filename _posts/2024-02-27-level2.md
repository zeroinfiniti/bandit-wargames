title: LEVEL 2

## Task
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **-**, located in the home directory.

**Username:** bandit1

**Password:** string provided in the *readme* file in the previous level

## Theory
The task is similiar to Level 1 in that I have to locate the file with a dash (-). 

Based on the previous level, I have determined that I will be in the home directory when I log in.

As such for this level, I will be only using the commands **ls** and **cat**. 

However, the file name is a dash (-). Typing this in the command line might make the command think I'm trying to type in a command option, e.g. typing *-p* means I'm choosing a port.

To located the *-* file, I will need to type in **./** before **-**. This dot slash (./) helps to hide the dash (-) from the command.

## Solution
**Step 1:** Log in using the username and password in the task.

**Step 2:** List out directory's contents using **ls**.

**Step 3:** Type in the command **cat ./-** to read the contents in the file.
