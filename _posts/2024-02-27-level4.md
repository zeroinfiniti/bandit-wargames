## Task
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.

**Username:** bandit3

**Password:** string provided in the *spaces in this filename* file in the previous level

## Theory
This time I have to navigate from the home directory to a different directory. This will require me to use the **cd** command.

One thing that stumped me for a while is that using the command **ls** didn't list the hidden files. I did some quick research and **ls** *only* list non-hidden files. To include hidden files, I have to use the command **ls -a**. 

All hidden files will have a dot (.) at the beginning of the filename, e.g. **.hidden**. 

## Solution
**Step 1:** Log in using the username and password in the task.

**Step 2:** Type **pwd** to confirm my location in the directory.

**Step 3:** Type **cd inhere** to change to the *inhere* directory.

**Step 4:** Type **ls -a** to list out all hidden and non-hidden files.

**Step 5:** Type **cat .hidden** to read the contents of the hidden file.
