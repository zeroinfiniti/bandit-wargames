## Task
Log into the game using SSH.

**Server:** bandit.labs.overthewire.org

**Port:** 2220

**Username:** bandit0

**Password:** bandit0

## Theory
**SSH** is short for *Secure Shell Protocol*. It is used to remotely connect two or more machines together and aims for secure communications.

Because SSH is a UNIX system while Windows 11 is based on the Windows NT kernel, I will have to download and install a SSH client.

Linux and Mac OS X already have SSH installed in their systems as both OSes are dervied from UNIX.

I downloaded and installed PuTTY after verifying that it is a legitimate program and comes from a legitimate website.

## Solution
**Step 1:** I connected to the server based on the host name and port number provided in the task.
